  :::div{icon="i-heroicons-fire" label="Ingredients"}
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - 3/4 cup warm water (about 110Â°F or 43Â°C)
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/4 cup plain yogurt
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted ghee
  :::

  :::div{icon="i-heroicons-list-bullet-20-solid" label="Instructions"}
  - **Activate the Yeast:**
    In a small bowl, combine the active dry yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
  - **Prepare the Dough:**
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking soda.
    Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and olive oil.

    Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
